# Diabetes Prediction.
●	Designed and implemented a diabetes detection model using Python, Pandas, PySpark, and MLLib for efficient data analysis and prediction.
●	Integrated machine learning algorithms into a user-friendly Flask interface, enabling real-time predictions and results for users.
●	Enhanced model accuracy through data pre-processing and feature engineering, contributing to accurate health assessments.

For the diabetes prediction model, you can use the well-known Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It includes medical information like glucose levels, insulin levels, and other predictors used to determine whether a patient has diabetes. Below is a description of the dataset and the corresponding features you can use:
Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
The dataset consists of several input features used to predict if a patient has diabetes. These are the features present in the dataset:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration (a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test).
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
Age: Age (years).
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1), where 0 represents non-diabetic and 1 represents diabetic.
